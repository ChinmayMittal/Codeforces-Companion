### What does the site do ?  
It is meant to be a handy tool for competitive programmers to visualize their progress, it uses the codeforces API to fetch user data and google charts and ReactJS to render it in a somewhat appealing manner.

If everything goes fine you should be able to see the site [here](https://cf-companion.netlify.app/)

**NOTE**: This exercise was aimed at learning ReactJS. The idea for the website is not mine, i just tried to recreate [Codeforces Visualizer](https://cfviz.netlify.app/)
